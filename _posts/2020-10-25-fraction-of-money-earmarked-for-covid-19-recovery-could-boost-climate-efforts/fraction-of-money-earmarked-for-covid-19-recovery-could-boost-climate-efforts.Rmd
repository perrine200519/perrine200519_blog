| general topic                      | Assessing the impact that the use of Covid-related funds could have if they were invested on global warming recovery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| procedure/what was examined        | To show what the impact on global warming could be if we used the money made available as a result of the Covid19 crisis on global warming recovery solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| conclusions/discovery              | The use of a part of the funds which are now given to Covid-19 related issues, to global warming recovery solutions, could improve the global environmental situation.  This could offer long-term benefits to governments as it could increase employment opportunities while stimulating innovation. This could allow one to develop new technologies and achieve low-carbon and fossil fuel bailout through short-term plans. |
