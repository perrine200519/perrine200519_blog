My name is Perrine Clynckemaillie, I am twenty years old and I study biology at UMons. I am currently in the second year of my bachelor. During my studies I was given the opportunity to better my English. I am in the class of Ms Van Lancker. In the future, I would like to work within the field of animal biology.
