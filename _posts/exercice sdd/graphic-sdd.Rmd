```

Zooplankton is an animal that is composed of marine organisms, they are small animals that can be herbivorous or carnivorous, it is important for the animals because it is a food reserve.

```{r}
SciViews:: R
data <- read("zooplankton", package = "data.io")
chart(data, area ~ feret ) +
  geom_point()
```

we notice that if feret increases, it is not for this reason that the area also increases, so there is not a linear relationship. There are some points which are extreme.
